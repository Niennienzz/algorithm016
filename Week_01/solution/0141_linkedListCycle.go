// Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
// There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached
// again by continuously following the next pointer.
//
// Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
// Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
